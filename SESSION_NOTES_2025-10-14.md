## Multi-Family Property Strategy

### Question Asked
"How to create an agent for multi-family properties?"

### Current Limitation
- Property type field not populated in existing data
- Missing multi-family metrics: unit count, cap rate, NOI, GRM

### Recommended Approach
1. **Short-term:** Manual Privy CSV imports
   - Search Privy.pro for multi-family (duplex, triplex, fourplex, apartment)
   - Export CSV weekly
   - Import via: `python3 modules/privy_importer.py ~/Downloads/privy-multifamily.csv --merge`

2. **Long-term:** SDMLS API integration
   - When credentials approved
   - Automated daily scans
   - Full property type classification
   - Multi-family specific metrics

### Test Case
Successfully imported 81 multi-family properties from ZIP 92128 with full owner intelligence.

## Key Learnings

### Data Source Strategy
**Best approach: Multi-source enrichment**
- SDMLS API for comprehensive MLS data
- Privy CSV for owner intelligence
- Combine strengths of both

### Owner Intelligence Value
**Privy provides signals not in standard MLS:**
- 91% absentee owner detection
- 59% investor ownership identification
- These signals = higher deal probability

### Weekly Workflow Efficiency
**15 minutes/week Privy import saves 16+ hours**
- Manual owner research: 10-15 min per property
- 81 properties Ã— 12 min = 16.2 hours
- ROI: Massive time savings

## Next Project Ready

All work committed and backed up. System ready for new project.

**Tag created:** `v2.1-privy-integration-2025-10-14`

**Questions for future sessions:**
1. When SDMLS credentials arrive, integrate SDMLS API
2. Should we build custom investment modeling in dashboard?
3. Create dedicated multi-family agent when data sources ready?
