---

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Contact SDMLS Data Access Department

**Option A: Online Request Form**
1. Visit: https://sdmls.com/nmsubscribers/data-access/
2. Click "Request Data Access" or "Apply for API Access"
3. Fill out the vendor application form

**Option B: Direct Contact**
- **Email:** support@sdmls.com
- **Phone:** (858) 795-4000
- **Subject:** "API Access Request for Property Data"

**In your request, mention:**
- You are an SDMLS member (or working through a member broker)
- You want access to **MLS Router API** (not legacy RETS)
- Purpose: Internal property search and analysis tool
- Expected usage: Low volume (monitoring 6 ZIP codes, ~500-1,000 properties)

### Step 2: Choose Access Tier

When SDMLS responds, they will offer access tiers:

**Recommended: Tiered Vendor Access Program**
- Best for small operations (1-2 clients)
- Lower monthly fees (~$25-50/month)
- May not require real-time (daily sync acceptable)
- Perfect for DealFinder Pro use case

**Alternative: Full Vendor Access**
- For larger operations or resellers
- Real-time data access
- Higher fees ($100-200/month + per-request fees)
- Only needed if monitoring 10,000+ properties

**Alternative: Direct Broker Access**
- If you're accessing for your own brokerage only
- May be included in your SDMLS membership
- Check with your broker admin

### Step 3: Sign Data Access Agreement

SDMLS will send you a **Broker Data Access Agreement**:

1. Review the terms (standard MLS data usage agreement)
2. Sign electronically or physically
3. Return to SDMLS

**Key terms to understand:**
- Data is for internal use only (not for public websites without IDX compliance)
- Cannot resell raw MLS data
- Must display listing agent attribution
- Must respect status changes (withdrawn, sold, etc.)

### Step 4: Receive API Credentials

After approval (~5-10 business days), you'll receive:

1. **MLS Router Vendor Dashboard** login
2. **API Bearer Token** (this is your SDMLS_API_TOKEN)
3. **API Documentation URL**
4. **Support contact information**

**Example credentials format:**
```
API Endpoint: https://api.mlsrouter.com
Bearer Token: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Organization ID: your-org-id
```

### Step 5: Add Credentials to DealFinder Pro

1. Open your `.env` file
2. Find the SDMLS section:
   ```bash
   # SDMLS (SAN DIEGO MLS) API - MLS Router
   SDMLS_API_TOKEN=
   ```

3. Paste your Bearer Token:
   ```bash
   SDMLS_API_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your_actual_token_here
   ```

4. Save the file

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env` to version control! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### Step 6: Test the Connection

Run the test script to verify credentials:

```bash
cd "/Users/mikekwak/Real Estate Valuation"
python3 integrations/sdmls_connector.py
```

**Expected output (test mode):**
```
üè† SDMLS MLS Router API Integration Test

Test 1: Connection Test
--------------------------------------------------
Result: {'success': True, 'test_mode': True, ...}

Test 2: Property Search
--------------------------------------------------
Found 1 properties (mock data)
...
‚úÖ Test Mode Complete!
```

**To test with real credentials:**

Create a test script `test_sdmls_real.py`:

```python
from integrations.sdmls_connector import SDMLSConnector

# Initialize with real credentials (test_mode=False)
connector = SDMLSConnector(test_mode=False)

# Test connection
print("Testing SDMLS connection...")
result = connector.test_connection()
print(f"Connection: {result}")

# Search properties in your target ZIP codes
print("\nSearching properties in target areas...")
properties = connector.search_properties(
    zip_codes=['92126', '92127', '92128', '92129', '92130', '92131'],
    price_min=500000,
    price_max=2000000,
    bedrooms_min=3,
    bathrooms_min=2,
    property_types=['Residential'],
    status='Active',
    limit=10
)

print(f"\nFound {len(properties)} properties")

if properties:
    print("\nFirst property:")
    p = properties[0]
    print(f"  MLS#: {p.get('mls_number')}")
    print(f"  Address: {p.get('street_address')}, {p.get('city')}")
    print(f"  Price: ${p.get('list_price'):,}")
    print(f"  Beds/Baths: {p.get('bedrooms')}/{p.get('bathrooms')}")
    print(f"  Sqft: {p.get('square_feet'):,}")
    print(f"  DOM: {p.get('days_on_market')} days")
```

Run it:
```bash
python3 test_sdmls_real.py
```

If successful, you'll see real San Diego MLS listings!

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SDMLS API token not found"
- Check that SDMLS_API_TOKEN is set in `.env`
- Make sure there's no space before or after the token
- Verify you're running from the correct directory

### Error: "401 Unauthorized"
- Token expired or invalid
- Request new token from MLS Router dashboard
- Check that token is complete (they're usually 500+ characters)

### Error: "403 Forbidden"
- Your account doesn't have permission for requested data
- Contact SDMLS to verify your access tier
- May need to upgrade from limited to full access

### Error: "Connection timeout"
- Check internet connection
- Verify API endpoint URL is correct
- SDMLS servers may be down (rare) - check status page

### No properties returned
- Filters may be too strict
- Try removing filters one by one
- Verify ZIP codes are in San Diego County
- Check that status='Active' has active listings

## Alternative: Continue Using HomeHarvest Scraper

If SDMLS API access is too expensive or takes too long:

**You can continue using your current setup:**
- `modules/scraper.py` - HomeHarvest library scrapes Realtor.com
- Cost: $0/month
- Reliability: Good (but fragile)
- Data quality: Acceptable (20-30 fields)

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**
- Use SDMLS API for critical North San Diego monitoring
- Use HomeHarvest for other markets (Las Vegas, etc.)
- Get best of both worlds
