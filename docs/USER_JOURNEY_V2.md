### Conversation Flow

**Exchange 1:**
```
User: "I'm looking for investment properties in San Diego"

AI: "San Diego market - excellent choice. Let's narrow it down.

What's your target price range? And are you focused on specific
neighborhoods, or open to anywhere in San Diego County?"
```

**Exchange 2:**
```
User: "Looking at La Jolla and Carmel Valley, budget is $600K to $1.2M"

AI: "La Jolla and Carmel Valley - strong appreciation areas.

For that price range, what's your minimum size requirement?
(beds/baths) And are you focused on cash flow, appreciation,
or a balanced approach?"
```

**Exchange 3:**
```
User: "Need at least 3 beds, 2 baths. Mainly looking for appreciation"

AI: "Got it - 3+ bed, 2+ bath properties in La Jolla (92037) and
Carmel Valley (92130), $600K-$1.2M range, appreciation focus.

One more question: What's your timeline? Looking to buy immediately,
or monitoring for the right opportunity over the next few months?"
```

**Exchange 4:**
```
User: "Flexible timeline, want to wait for the right deal"

AI: "Perfect. I've configured your search agent based on our conversation.

Review the criteria on the right, and when ready, enter your name
to create your agent. It'll start monitoring immediately and check
properties every 4 hours."
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- Messages appear with smooth animations
- AI avatar (gradient blue circle with bot icon)
- User avatar (solid blue circle with user icon)

**Key UX Principles:**
1. **Conversational:** Feels like talking to a person
2. **Progressive:** Builds up information step-by-step
3. **Forgiving:** User can provide info in any order
4. **Smart:** AI extracts data even if messy input
5. **Fast:** AI responds in 2-4 seconds

## Phase 5: Autonomous Monitoring (Ongoing)

### What Happens Automatically

**Every 4 Hours:**
```
1. Scheduler triggers agent check
2. Agent loads latest property scan data
3. Filters properties by ZIP codes
4. Applies price/beds/baths filters
5. Calculates match score for each (0-100)
6. Filters by minimum score (default 80)
7. Checks for duplicates
8. Stores new matches in database
9. Creates GHL opportunities
10. Sends notifications
11. Updates last_check timestamp
```

**User's Perspective:**
- Zero manual work required
- Matches appear in GHL automatically
- Notifications via SMS/Email/GHL
- Can pause/resume anytime via API

**Background Activity Log:**
```

## Phase 7: Management (In GHL)

### User's Workflow (All in GoHighLevel)

**Daily Routine:**
```
1. Log into GoHighLevel
2. Check "Investment Properties" pipeline
3. See new opportunities in "New Match" stage
4. Review property details and match scores
5. Move interesting ones to "Reviewing" stage
6. Contact sellers for promising properties
7. Move to "Under Contract" when offer accepted
```

**GHL Workflows (User Configures):**

- New opportunity → Add to calendar for review
- Moved to "Reviewing" → Send email to team
- Moved to "Under Contract" → Trigger celebration

**User NEVER Returns to DealFinder (Unless...):**
- ✅ Want to create another agent
- ✅ Need to pause/modify agent (future feature)
- ❌ Daily property checking (not needed!)
- ❌ Managing matches (done in GHL)
- ❌ Setting up notifications (in GHL)

## Key Experience Differentiators

### vs Traditional Property Search Tools

**Old Way (Zillow, Redfin, etc.):**
```
Day 1:  Spend 15 min setting up saved search with filters
Day 2:  Check email for new listings (20 min)
Day 3:  Check email (15 min)
Day 4:  Check email (15 min)
Day 5:  Check email (20 min) → Find something interesting
Week 2: Still checking daily...
Month: Burned out, stop checking, miss opportunities
```

**DealFinder Way:**
```
Day 1:  Chat with AI for 3 min → Agent created
Day 2:  Check GHL → 2 matches waiting
Day 3:  Nothing (agent still monitoring)
Day 4:  Nothing
Day 5:  Check GHL → 1 new match
Week 2: Check GHL when notified
Month: Still getting relevant matches, zero daily effort
```

**Time Savings:**
- Setup: 15 min → 3 min (80% reduction)
- Daily maintenance: 15 min → 0 min (100% elimination)
- Monthly time investment: 300+ min → 3 min (99% reduction)

### vs Building In-House
- **Development:** $10K+ vs $50/mo
- **Maintenance:** Ongoing dev time vs zero
- **Setup time:** Weeks vs 3 minutes
- **AI sophistication:** DIY vs Claude-powered

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Scenario: Vague Criteria
**User:** "I just want good deals"

**AI Response:**
"I'd love to help find good deals. To configure your agent effectively, I need a bit more specificity:

1. What area are you focused on? (City, county, or specific ZIP codes)
2. What's your approximate budget range?
3. Any size requirements? (bedrooms, bathrooms)

Even rough answers help - we can always refine later."

### Scenario: Unrealistic Criteria
**User:** "5+ bed homes under $300K in Beverly Hills"

**AI Response:**
"I understand you're looking for value. However, 5+ bedroom homes under $300K in Beverly Hills 90210 are extremely rare (essentially non-existent in current market).

Would you like to:
1. Increase budget to $800K+ for Beverly Hills
2. Expand to nearby areas (Culver City, Mar Vista)
3. Reduce size requirement to 3-4 beds

Which direction makes more sense for your goals?"

### Scenario: API Failure
**System:** FastAPI is down

**UI Behavior:**
- Show friendly error message
- "Our servers are temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."
- Preserve conversation history
- Allow retry without losing data

### Scenario: No Matches for Weeks
**Agent:** Finds 0 matches for 2 weeks

**Proactive Communication:**
Email to user:
"Your agent has been monitoring for 2 weeks without finding matches. Your criteria might be too specific. Would you like to chat with AI again to broaden your search?"
