# Database Status

## Current Situation

PostgreSQL is **not installed** on this system. The `psql` command is not available.

## Impact

### ✅ What STILL WORKS:
- All GHL integration features
- Agent decision making (AI still works!)
- Agent tool usage
- Creating opportunities in GHL
- Custom field population
- Everything except persistent memory storage

### ⚠️  What's Limited:
- Agents won't store memories between runs
- No learned patterns saved to database
- No agent performance metrics tracked
- Agents work in "stateless" mode (fresh start each time)

## Options

### Option 1: Install PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL on macOS
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14

# Create database
createdb dealfinder

# Run schema
psql dealfinder < database/agent_memory_schema.sql
```

### Option 2: Use Without Database (Current - Works Fine for Testing!)
- Agents work perfectly without database
- Just no memory persistence between runs
- Great for testing and demos
- You can add database later anytime

### Option 3: Alternative Database
- Could use SQLite instead (lightweight, no server needed)
- Would need to adapt schema
- Good middle ground option

## Recommendation

**For now: Continue without database**
- Test the GHL integration
- See agents in action
- Install PostgreSQL later if you want persistent agent memory

The system is designed to work with or without the database!
