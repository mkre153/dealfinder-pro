   - Got new sub-account API credentials
   - Updated .env with new Location ID: `BUBjaBnB1qp6NfrTYYoo`
   - Successfully connected to new sub-account

2. **Custom Fields Created** (10/10 Opportunity Fields)
   - Deal_score
   - Property_address
   - List_price
   - Est_profit
   - Mls_id
   - Price_per_sqft
   - Below_market_pct
   - Days_on_market
   - Deal_quality
   - Estimated_arv

   **Field Mapping Created:** `ghl_field_mapping.py` with correct API field keys

3. **Pipeline Created**
   - Name: "Investment Properties"
   - Pipeline ID: `ZHnsDZ6eQJYvnxFR0DMU`
   - 8 Stages created:
     1. New Lead
     2. Hot Lead
     3. Priority Review
     4. Showing Scheduled
     5. Offer Submitted
     6. Under Contract
     7. Closed Won
     8. Closed Lost

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Getting Stage IDs**: Need to extract stage IDs from browser dev tools
  - GHL v1 API endpoints for pipelines/opportunities are not accessible
  - Will need manual extraction from browser

### 📋 Next Steps (When You Return)

1. **Get Stage IDs** (5 minutes)
   - Open browser dev tools on pipeline edit page
   - Extract stage IDs using JavaScript console or HTML inspector
   - Update .env file with stage IDs

2. **Create Database Tables** (2 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/mikekwak/Real Estate Valuation"
   psql dealfinder < database/agent_memory_schema.sql
   ```

3. **Test Full Integration** (5 minutes)
   - Run agent + GHL integration test
   - Verify opportunity creation with custom fields
   - Check that agent creates opportunities in correct pipeline stages

## 🔑 Important Information

### GHL Credentials (New Sub-Account)
- Location ID: `BUBjaBnB1qp6NfrTYYoo`
- API Key: (stored in .env)
- Pipeline ID: `ZHnsDZ6eQJYvnxFR0DMU`

### GHL Custom Field Keys (Actual API Keys)
```python
{
    "deal_score": "dealscore",
    "property_address": "propertyaddress",
    "list_price": "list_price",
    "est_profit": "estprofit",
    "mls_id": "mls_id",
    "price_per_sqft": "price_per_sqft",
    "below_market_pct": "below_market_pct",
    "days_on_market": "days_on_market",
    "deal_quality": "deal_quality",
    "estimated_arv": "estimated_arv"
}
```

## 🚧 Known Issues

1. **GHL v1 API Limitations**
   - Pipeline endpoints return 404
   - Opportunity creation endpoint returns 404
   - May need to use v2 API or different endpoint structure
   - **Workaround**: Extract stage IDs manually from browser

2. **Stage IDs Missing**
   - Need to populate these in .env:
     - GHL_STAGE_NEW
     - GHL_STAGE_HOT
     - GHL_STAGE_PRIORITY
     - GHL_STAGE_SHOWING
     - GHL_STAGE_OFFER
     - GHL_STAGE_CONTRACT
     - GHL_STAGE_WON
     - GHL_STAGE_LOST

## 📊 Setup Progress: 85% Complete

## 💡 When You Resume

**Quick Start:**
1. Open GHL pipeline edit page
2. Use browser dev tools to get stage IDs
3. Update .env file
4. Run integration test

**Or we can:**
