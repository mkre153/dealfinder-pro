**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Current Progress**: 60% â†’ 100%

Let's complete the setup so agents can create opportunities in GHL automatically!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What We'll Do

1. âœ… Check which custom fields you already have (5 min)
2. âœ… Create missing custom fields (10 min)
3. âœ… Create "Investment Properties" pipeline (10 min)
4. âœ… Get Pipeline & Stage IDs (3 min)
5. âœ… Create database tables (2 min)
6. âœ… Test full integration (5 min)

---

## Step 1: Check Existing Custom Fields (5 min)

You already have **43 custom fields** in your GHL account. Let's see which ones you have.

### Login to GHL
1. Go to: https://app.gohighlevel.com/
2. Login to **"Real Estate Valuation"** account

### Check Custom Fields
1. Click: **Settings** (left sidebar)
2. Click: **Custom Fields**
3. Select: **Opportunities** tab

### Compare with Required Fields

**For Opportunities - We Need:**
- [ ] `deal_score` (Number)
- [ ] `property_address` (Text)
- [ ] `list_price` (Currency)
- [ ] `est_profit` (Currency)
- [ ] `mls_id` (Text)
- [ ] `price_per_sqft` (Number)
- [ ] `below_market_pct` (Number)
- [ ] `days_on_market` (Number)
- [ ] `deal_quality` (Dropdown)
- [ ] `estimated_arv` (Currency)

**Check the box next to each field you already have.**

If you have similar field names (like "Deal Score" instead of "deal_score"), that's fine - we can use those!

---

## Step 2: Create Missing Custom Fields (10 min)

For each field you DON'T have, create it:

### For Opportunities

Still in **Settings â†’ Custom Fields â†’ Opportunities**:

Click **+ Add Custom Field** for each missing field:

#### Example: Create "deal_score"
1. Click **+ Add Custom Field**
2. **Field Label**: `Deal Score`
3. **Field Key**: `deal_score` (auto-generated)
4. **Field Type**: **Number**
5. **Placeholder**: `0-100`
6. Click **Save**

Repeat for all missing fields:

| Field Label | Field Type | Dropdown Options (if applicable) |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Deal Score | Number | - |
| Property Address | Text (Single Line) | - |
| List Price | Currency | - |

| Price Per Sqft | Number | - |

| Location Preference | Text (Single Line) | - |
| Property Type Preference | Dropdown | Single Family, Multi-Family, Condo, Townhouse |

| Buyer Status | Dropdown | Active, Passive, On Hold |

**âœ… When done, you'll have all required custom fields!**

## Step 3: Create "Investment Properties" Pipeline (10 min)

### Navigate to Pipelines
1. Click **Opportunities** (left sidebar)
2. Click **Pipelines** (top tab)

### Create New Pipeline
1. Click **+ Create Pipeline** (top right)
2. **Pipeline Name**: `Investment Properties`
3. Click **Create**

### Add Stages

You'll see your new empty pipeline. Now add stages:

1. Click **+ Add Stage** (or similar button)

Add these stages **in this order**:

1. **New Lead**
   - Stage Name: `New Lead`
   - Click Save

2. **Hot Lead**
   - Stage Name: `Hot Lead`
   - Click Save

3. **Priority Review**
   - Stage Name: `Priority Review`
   - Click Save

4. **Showing Scheduled**
   - Stage Name: `Showing Scheduled`
   - Click Save

5. **Offer Submitted**
   - Stage Name: `Offer Submitted`
   - Click Save

6. **Under Contract**
   - Stage Name: `Under Contract`
   - Click Save

7. **Closed Won**
   - Stage Name: `Closed Won`
   - Click Save

8. **Closed Lost**
   - Stage Name: `Closed Lost`
   - Click Save

**âœ… You should now have 8 stages in your pipeline!**

---

## Step 4: Get Pipeline & Stage IDs (3 min)

Now we need to copy the IDs to your `.env` file.

### Get Pipeline ID

1. You should still be viewing your "Investment Properties" pipeline
2. Look at the browser address bar URL
3. It will look like:
   ```
   https://app.gohighlevel.com/location/aCyEjbERq92wlaVNIQuH/opportunities/pipelines/YOUR_PIPELINE_ID/stages
   ```
4. Copy the Pipeline ID (the long string after `/pipelines/`)

**Write it here**: _______________________

### Get Stage IDs

For each stage, click on it and copy the ID from the URL:

1. Click **New Lead** stage
2. URL changes to: `.../stages/STAGE_ID_HERE`
3. Copy that stage ID

**Write them here**:
- New Lead: _______________________
- Hot Lead: _______________________
- Priority Review: _______________________
- Showing Scheduled: _______________________
- Offer Submitted: _______________________
- Under Contract: _______________________
- Closed Won: _______________________
- Closed Lost: _______________________

### Add to .env File

Now let's add these to your `.env` file. I'll help you with this!

## Step 5: Create Database Tables (2 min)

This creates the tables where agents store what they learn.

### Run SQL Command

```bash
cd "/Users/mikekwak/Real Estate Valuation"
psql dealfinder < database/agent_memory_schema.sql
```

**Expected output**:
```
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
CREATE FUNCTION
...
Agent memory schema created successfully!
```

**If you get an error about database**:
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Make sure database "dealfinder" exists
- You may need to add your postgres password to `.env`

**âœ… When successful, agents can store memories!**

---

## Step 6: Test Full Integration (5 min)

Now for the exciting part - watch an agent create a real opportunity in GHL!

### Run the GHL Integration Test

```bash
cd "/Users/mikekwak/Real Estate Valuation"
python examples/agents/agent_ghl_integration.py
```

**What should happen**:
1. Agent evaluates test property
2. Makes decision to create opportunity
3. Chooses pipeline stage (likely "Hot Lead")
4. Creates opportunity in GHL
5. Shows success message with opportunity ID

### Verify in GHL Dashboard

1. Go back to GHL in your browser
2. Click **Opportunities**
3. Select **"Investment Properties"** pipeline
4. You should see a new opportunity:
   - **Name**: "123 Sunset Blvd, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 - Score: 92"
   - **Stage**: Hot Lead
   - **Custom Fields**: Populated with property data

**âœ… If you see it, setup is COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Pipeline not found"
- Double-check Pipeline ID in `.env`
- Make sure you copied the entire ID

### "Stage not found"
- Double-check Stage IDs in `.env`
- Each stage needs its own ID

### "Custom field not found"
- Make sure field keys match exactly
- Check spelling (deal_score vs dealScore)

### "Database connection failed"
- Add DB_PASSWORD to `.env`
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running

---

## After Successful Test

You'll have:
- âœ… Intelligent agents working
- âœ… GHL opportunities created automatically
- âœ… Custom fields populated with property data
- âœ… Correct pipeline stages selected
- âœ… Agent memory stored in database

**Next**: Build custom agents for your specific workflow!
