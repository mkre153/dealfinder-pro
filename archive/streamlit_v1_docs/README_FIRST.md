## 🎓 How It Works

```
Property Data → Agent Analyzes → Decision Made → Opportunity Created
                    ↓                  ↓                    ↓
               (Claude AI)      (Yes/No + Why)    (10 fields mapped)
```

**Example Decision:**
```
Property: 789 Investment Blvd, LA - $1.85M
Deal Score: 94/100
Agent Decision: YES (95% confidence)
Reasoning: "Exceptional opportunity with 18.5% below market
           pricing, $350K profit potential, excellent schools
           (9.8 rating), motivated seller..."
```
